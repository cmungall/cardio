comment: Infundibular pulmonic stenosis is mostly caused by overgrowth of the heart muscle wall (hypertrophy of the septoparietal trabeculae). Pulmonic stenosis is often seen as a part of Fallot' s tetralogy, in which case the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause of the pulmonic stenosis. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations seen in patients with Fallot tetralogy, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis. The degree of stenosis varies between individuals with TOF, and is the primary determinant of symptoms and severity. This malformation is infrequently described as sub-pulmonary stenosis or subpulmonary obstruction.

def: "Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a type of ventriculoarterial connection in which both great vessels arise entirely or predominantly from the right ventricle." [HPO:probinson, pmid:10798433]
comment: During the development of the heart, the outflow tract initially connects exclusively with the primitive right ventricle and must undergo extensive remodelling to divide into a separate pulmonary artery and aorta; subsequently, there is continued remodelling to establish direct continuity from the left ventricle to the aorta. DORV encompasses a wide spectrum of anatomic arrangements and pathophysiologic disturbances. At one end of the spectrum, it mimics tetralogy of Fallot in the presence of pulmonary stenosis, or a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) in the absence of such stenosis. At the other end of the spectrum, it behaves like transposition of the great arteries with a VSD.

The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms. Obstruction of hepatic venous outflow is mainly caused by primary intravascular thrombosis, which can occur suddenly or be repeated over time, accompanied by some revascularization, accounting for the variable parenchymal hepatic damage and histologic presentation.

comment: Most individuals aged over 60 years have progressively enlarging deposits of calcium mineral in their major arteries. This vascular calcification reduces aortic and arterial elastance, which impairs cardiovascular hemodynamics, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality in the form of hypertension, aortic stenosis, cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial and lower-limb ischemia, congestive heart failure, and compromised structural integrity.The severity and extent of mineralization reflect atherosclerotic plaque burden and strongly and independently predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

[HPO:probinson]
comment: Regitine produces an alpha-adrenergic block of relatively short duration. In the regitine blocking test, regitine is injected rapidly and bood pressure is recorded immediately after injection, at 30-second intervals for the first 3 minutes, and at 60-second intervals for the next 7 minutes. A positive response to the reginitine blocking test is present when the blood pressure is reduced more than 35 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. A typical positive response is a reduction in pressure of 60 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. A positive response is suggestive of pheochromocytoma and should generally be confirmed by other diagnostic procedures such as measurement of urinary catecholamines or their metabolites.

comment: The ventricular response to atrial fibrillation is irregularly irregular because of the large number of atrial impulses that transit the atrioventricular node, making the ventricle partially refractory to further impulses. Atrial fibrillation can cause a number of manifestations including excessive ventricular response with angina pectoris or hypotension in susceptible individuals, syncope, systemic embolization, fatigue, or anxiety. These features should be coded separately.

comment: During atrioventricular valvuloseptal morphogenesis, the endocardial cushions expand as they are infiltrated by extracellular matrix secreted from the surrounding myocardium. The cushions then fuse and are remodeled to form the atrioventricular valves and septa. Failure of this process results in AVSD, with the degree of severity dependent on the stage at which the developmental failure occurs. AVSD are a spectrum of cardiac malformations that result in a persistent common atrioventricular canal.

comment: The lesions are variable in size and location, and frequently follow the course of a major retinal vein. Epiretinal membranes are a common feature. In contrast to retinal capillary hemangiomas, cavernous hemangiomas lack prominent feeder vessels, intraretinal exudate, and surrounding subretinal fluid. Because the fundoscopic features are characteristic, diagnosis can generally be made based upon clinical appearance.

comment: This feature is most often seen in the disease arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). ARVC is defined histologically by the presence of progressive replacement of right ventricular myocardium with adipose and fibrous tissue often confined to a triangle of dysplasia comprising the right ventricular inflow, outflow, and apex. While these pathologic abnormalities can result in functional and morphological right ventricular abnormalities, they also occur in the left ventricle, producing a DCM phenotype, or can be present in the absence of clinically detectable structural changes in either ventricle. For the purposes of this classification, ARVC is defined by the presence of right ventricular dysfunction (global or regional), with or without left ventricular disease, in the presence of histological evidence for the disease and/or electrocardiographic abnormalities in accordance with published criteria.

comment: Left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC), also known as spongy myocardium, is a distinct form of cardiomyopathy occurring in-utero when segments of spongy myocardium fail to transform into compact, mature musculature resulting in prominent myocardial trabeculae, deep intra-trabecular recesses, and decreased cardiac function. It has been proposed that LVNC results from arrest of the compaction process during the second month of embryological development.

comment: Tetralogy of Fallot with Pulmonary Atresia (TOF/PA) is a complex lesion with many different anatomic variants. The primary source of variability in this lesion is in the anatomy of the pulmonary arteries, with the spectrum ranging from well-formed, confluent pulmonary artery branches to completely absent native pulmonary arteries and major aorto-pulmonary collaterals (MAPCA's) providing all the pulmonary blood flow. The majority of cases fall somewhere in between these two ends of the spectrum, with the total pulmonary blood flow provided by a combination of diminutive native pulmonary arteries and multiple MAPCA.

comment: Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium is a cardiomyopathy thought to be caused by arrest of normal embryogenesis of the endocardium and myocardium. This abnormality is often associated with other congenital cardiac defects, but it is also seen in the absence of other cardiac anomalies. During early embryonic development, the myocardium is a loose network of interwoven fibers separated by deep recesses that link the myocardium with the left ventricular cavity. Gradual compaction of this spongy meshwork of fibers and intertrabecular recesses, or sinusoids, occurs between weeks 5 and 8 of embryonic life, proceeding from the epicardium to endocardium and from the base of the heart to the apex. Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM) is an uncommon finding. It is thought to be caused by arrest of the normal process of endomyocardial morphogenesis. The left ventricle is uniformly affected, but biventricular noncompaction has been reported, with right ventricular noncompaction described in less than one-half of patients. Because of difficulty in distinguishing normal variants in the highly trabeculated right ventricle from the pathological noncompacted ventricle, several authors dispute the existence of right ventricular noncompaction [pmid:15210614].

comment: Myocarditis can be caused by a variety of bacterial and viral infections. Enteroviruses, especially coxsackievirus B, are often associated with acute myocarditis. nHowever, with the advent of genetic analysis, adenovirus and parvovirus B19 have also been found to be frequent causes of myocarditis. Exposure to drug treatment, physical stimuli such as radiation and heat, metabolic disorders, immune disorders, and pregnancy are also causes of myocarditis. Many cases of myocarditis are idiopathic. Myocarditis presents with non-specific symptoms including chest pain, dyspnoea, and palpitations, and thus often mimics more common disorders such as coronary artery disease. In some patients, cardiac MRI and endomyocardial biopsy can help identify myocarditis, predict risk of cardiovascular events, and guide treatment.

def: "In wound repair, neovascularization (NV) involves the sprouting of new vessels from pre-existent vessels to repair or replace damaged vessels. In the retina, NV is a response to ischemia. The NV adheres to the inner surface of the retina and outer surface of the vitreous. NV are deficient in tight junctions and hence leak plasma into surrounding tissue including the vitreous. Plasma causes the vitreous gel to degenerate, contract, and eventually collapse which pulls on the retina. Since retinal NV is adherent to both retina and vitreous, as the vitreous contracts the NV may be sheared resulting in vitreous hemorrhage or the NV may remain intact and pull the retina with the vitreous resulting in retinal elevation referred to as traction retinal detachment." [PMID:23329331]

In severe cases of dysplasia, the tricuspid valve orifice may become unguarded. Although there is a broad morphologic spectrum, these malformations lead to the same hemodynamic burden, namely, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and its pathophysiological sequelae.

def: "Rapid swelling (edema) of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and submucosal tissues of the skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the tongue during a period of minutes to several hours. The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands. Angioedema is similar to urticaria, but the swelling is subcutaneous rather than on the epidermis." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Apart from the common form, mediated by allergy, it has been reported as a side effect of some medications, in particular ACE inhibitors. Additionally, there are three autosomal dominant inherited forms known, due to mutations in the genes that control the clotting cascade, including the SERPING1 gene, which results in deficiency of the blood protein C1-inhibitor (type I HAE) and the F12 gene, which controls Factor XII (type III HAE). There is an additional type in which C1 levels are normal but C1 function is decreased (type II HAE). All three forms are called hereditary angioedema (HAE) or occasionally by the outdated term 'hereditary angioneurotic edema' (HANE). In all forms of HAE, swelling may also occur in the digestive tract and other organs. It is life-threatening when it involves the larynx due to the potential for asphyxiation.
