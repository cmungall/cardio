namespace: biological_process
def: "An adrenergic receptor signaling pathway that contributes to an increase in frequency or rate of heart contraction. Binding of adrenalin or noradrenalin to a beta-adrenergic receptor on the surface of the signal-receiving cell results in the activation of an intracellular Gs protein. Gs activates adenylate cyclase to increase intracellular cyclic-AMP (cAMP) levels. cAMP binds directly to F-channels to allow an inward flow of sodium (known as funny current, or If current). The funny current is responsible for membrane depolarization and an increase in heart rate." [GOC:BHF, GOC:bf, GOC:mtg_cardiac_conduct_nov11, PMID:21099118]

namespace: biological_process
def: "An adrenergic receptor signaling pathway that contributes to a reduction in cardiac muscle contraction. Beta-adrenergic receptor-induced cardiac relaxation is achieved by a GPCR-activated adenylate cyclase generating cAMP; cAMP then activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane protein PLB. In its non-phosphorylated state, PLB acts as an inhibitor of the ATPase Ca(2+) pump of the cardiac SR (SERCA2a); inhibition of the pump is relieved upon phosphorylation. The pump removes Ca(2+) from the cytoplasm, thereby preventing cytosolic Ca(2+)-dependent activation of contractile proteins, leading to enhanced muscle relaxation."

The G-beta/gamma complex binds directly to the inward-rectifying potassium channel IKACh. Once the ion channel is activated, potassium ions (K+) flow out of the cell and cause it to hyperpolarize.

comment: This relation is currently used to connect two regulation processes p1 and p2, such that if r1 regulates p1 and r2 regulates p2, and r1 results_in r2 then the regulation of p1 is required for the regulation of p2. For an example of use, see GO:0035958 'regulation of glyoxylate cycle by regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter'. Note that a precise definition of this relation is under discussion. After it has been formalized it will be added to RO, where it will have a RO ID. Note that the existing identifier and label are subject to change.
