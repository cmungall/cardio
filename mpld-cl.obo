def: "A tissue-resident macrophage of the reticuloendothelial system found on the luminal surface of the hepatic sinusoids involved in erythrocyte clearance. Markers include F4/80+, CD11b-low, CD68-positive, sialoadhesin-positive, CD163/SRCR-positive. Irregular, with long processes including lamellipodia extending into the sinusoid lumen, have flattened nucleus with cytoplasm containing characteristic invaginations of the plasma membrane (vermiform bodies); lie within the sinusoid lumen attached to the endothelial surface; derived from the bone marrow, form a major part of the body's mononuclear phagocyte system."

comment: Markers: Mouse: F4/80+, CD11b-low, CD68+, sialoadhesin+, CD163/SRCR+; role or process: immune, antigen-presentation, clearance of senescent erythrocytes, iron metabolism. Kupffer cells are also reportedly C3aR-positive, CD14-low, CD54-positive, CD88-positive, and CD284-positive. They are also capable of producing IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, nitric oxide, PGD2, PGE2, PGF2alpha, and TXA2.

def: "An endothelial cell comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures and can be squamous or cuboidal. In mammals, endothelial cell has vimentin filaments and is derived from the mesoderm." [GOC:tfm, MESH:D042783, PMID:21275341, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelial_cell, https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=440764&aid=3364936&group_id=36855]
comment: From FMA: 9.07.2001: Endothelial cell has always been classified as a kind of epithelial cell, specifically a squamous cell but that is not true. First, endothelial cell can either be squamous or cuboidal (e.g. high-endothelial cell) and secondly, it has different embryological derivation (mesodermal) than a true epithelial cell (ectodermal and endodermal). The basis for present classification is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell. Endothelial cell has vimentin filaments while an epithelial cell has keratin filaments. [Onard].

Pericytes are present in capillaries where proper adventitia and muscle layer are missing (thus distingushing this cell type from adventitial cells). They are relatively undifferentiated and may become fibroblasts, macrophages, or smooth muscle cells." [GOC:dsd, GOC:tfm, ISBN:0721662544, MESH:D020286, PMID:16807374, PMID:17986482, PMID:20024907]

A subpopulation is CD248-positive. They are also capable of producing angiopoietin 1, CXCL12, TGF-beta, and VEGF-A.

def: "Cardiac muscle cells are striated muscle cells that are responsible for heart contraction. In mammals, the contractile fiber resembles those of skeletal muscle but are only one third as large in diameter, are richer in sarcoplasm, and contain centrally located instead of peripheral nuclei." [GOC:mtg_cardiacconduct_nov11, GOC:tfm, ISBN:0323052908, PMID:22426062, PMID:4711263]
comment: This class encompasses the muscle cells responsible for heart* contraction in both vertebrates and arthropods.  The ultrastucture of a wide range of arthropod heart cells has been examined including spiders, horseshoe crabs, crustaceans (see Sherman, 1973 and refs therein) and insects (see Lehmacher et al (2012) and refs therein).  According to these refs, the cells participating in heart contraction in all cases are transversely striated.  Insects hearts additionally contain ostial cells, also transversely striated muscle cells, but which do not participate in heart contraction.
