The lamprey's camera-like eye has a lens, an iris and extra-ocular muscles (five of them, unlike the eyes of jawed vertebrates, which have six), although it lacks intra-ocular muscles. Its retina also has a structure very similar to that of the retinas of other vertebrates, with three nuclear layers comprised of the cell bodies of photoreceptors and bipolar, horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells. The southern hemisphere lamprey, Geotria australis, possesses five morphological classes of retinal photoreceptor and five classes of opsin, each of which is closely related to the opsins of jawed vertebrates. Given these similarities, we reach the inescapable conclusion that the last common ancestor of jawless and jawed vertebrates already possessed an eye that was comparable to that of extant lampreys and gnathostomes. Accordingly, a vertebrate camera-like eye must have been present by the time that lampreys and gnathostomes diverged, around 500 Mya.[well established][VHOG]" xsd:string

Posteriorly they join the transverse septum to form the adult pericardial membrane, or pericardium. (...) In their partitioning of their coelom, embryonic mammals resemble first early fishes (incomplete partition, posterior to heart, consisting of the transverse septum) and then reptiles (pericardium derived from transverse septum and pleuropericardial membranes). Mammals then separate paired pleural cavities from the peritoneal cavity by a diaphragm. The ventral portion of this organ comes from the transverse septum.

In addition, the zebrafish liver does not have Kuppfer cells. Furthermore, a clear distinction can be made between the male and female liver in the adult zebrafish.

comment: WP:Heart states: \"The SA node is found in all amniotes but not in more primitive vertebrates. In these animals, the muscles of the heart are relatively continuous and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Indeed, since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium.\". Note however that ZFA has SA node.

These vessels do not anastomose with each other, but form what are called end-arteries. In their outward course they give off lateral branches; these are the afferent vessels for the renal corpuscles; they enter the capsule, and end in the glomerulus. From each tuft the corresponding efferent vessel arises, and, having made its egress from the capsule near to the point where the afferent vessel enters, breaks up into a number of branches, which form a dense plexus within Bowman's capsule."

It is a feature of the evolutionary primitive state. In amphibians it is called the bulbus cordis, a term that is also used for its equivalent in mammalian embryos. The more derived extant bony fish, like the zebrafish, do not have this cardiac compartment. They have a so-called bulbus arteriosus, which is not enclosed by cardiac muscle, but by elastic tissue and smooth muscle, and therefore is considered to be a specialization of the proximal part of the ventral aorta (256). However, similar to the mammalian condition (306, 326, 339), the bulbus arteriosus in zebrafish embryonic hearts is surrounded by myocardium that disappears with development (134, 135). The bony fish bulbus arteriosus might thus be homologous to the shark conus arteriosus and amphibian/mammalian bulbus cordis.[well established][VHOG]" xsd:string
